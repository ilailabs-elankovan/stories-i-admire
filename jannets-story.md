### *The Value of Resilience and Self-Belief*  
When asked about her biggest failure, Janet doesn’t shy away: “I lost millions on one deal.” However, she explains that these moments taught her invaluable lessons. “People would criticize me harshly—even to the point of telling me I should quit—but I didn’t let that define me. What I learned is that you need to figure out your happiness for yourself.”  

Janet’s journey began at 18, when she moved to Italy alone—a bold choice that set the tone for her independent life. “I’ve never lived by society’s rules. I didn’t get a high school diploma, but I ended up excelling in university and even earning a master’s in business. I realized that the only person’s expectations I needed to meet were my own.”

### *On Aging and Thriving at 58*

### *The Turning Point: Letting Go of Others’ Opinions*  
One of the most transformative changes in Janet’s life came when she stopped caring about what others thought. “People always have opinions, but if you try to please everyone, you’ll never be true to yourself. For me, success is about living authentically.”

### *A Career Built on Passion and Perseverance*  
Today, Janet runs 12 restaurants in Toronto and two in Los Angeles. Her journey into the restaurant business wasn’t conventional, but it was guided by her passions for food, travel, and business. “I’m lucky because I get to combine what I love with what I do. Not everyone discovers their passions, but when you do, it’s worth pursuing them.”  

She admits that success in her industry goes far beyond food. “A restaurant isn’t just about what’s on the plate. It’s about atmosphere, service, location, and the vision behind it. Like a great film, every element needs to work together.”

### *Risk and Reward: A Personal Approach*  
For those hesitant to take risks, Janet offers practical advice. “Risk depends on your stage in life. When I opened my first restaurant at 30, I had nothing to lose. But risk isn’t just about what you might lose—it’s also about what you might miss out on by not trying. Regret weighs heavier than failure.”

### *Building Strong Foundations*  
When reflecting on her journey, Janet emphasizes the importance of patience and preparation. “I see too many people rushing to expand without building a strong foundation. That’s a recipe for disaster. Take the time to do it right. I moved back home at 30 to save money and build a solid base for my dreams. It wasn’t glamorous, but it was worth it.”

### *The Truth About Happiness and Success*  
Janet is candid about the illusion that wealth guarantees happiness. “I know billionaires who chased money, thinking it would make them happy, only to realize it didn’t. Happiness comes from within. It’s about understanding who you are and what truly fulfills you. Money can’t buy that clarity.”  

Her advice for finding happiness? Simplify. “We overcomplicate life. Focus on your daily habits—what you do in the morning, afternoon, and evening. Break it down and ask yourself if those actions align with the life you want to build.”

### *Final Thoughts: Live Authentically*  
Janet’s journey is a testament to the power of resilience, passion, and self-awareness. Her parting advice? “Life is short. Live your best life—not the one others expect of you. Do the inner work, figure out what you want, and go after it with everything you’ve got. No one is going to hand you your dream life on a silver platter—it’s up to you to create it.”  

Her words are an inspiring reminder that success isn’t just about wealth or accolades; it’s about living authentically and finding joy in the journey.
